+# Tools for GNS3 GUI
+
+Tools are executables, that are called by the GNS3 GUI.
+They normally use the GNS3 API (http://api.gns3.net/) to
+query and/or modify the current project.
+
+The tools are stored in the GNS3 -> tools folder.
+A project must be open, to use/start them. They are
+called by the GUI with the following parameters:
+
+| No.  | Parameter                                  |
+|------|--------------------------------------------|
+|   1  |   GNS3 version (for compatibility checks)  |
+|   2  |   Project UUID                             |
+|   3+ |   List of selected items, can be empty     |
+
+An item consists of it's UUID prefixed by `nodes/`
+for node items, `text_drawings/` for text items
+and `drawings/` for all other graphical elements.
+Links are currently not included in the item list.
+
+The tool can be accompanied by a JSON file, with the
+same base name as the tool, but with the .json extension.
+
+It can set the following options:
+
+| Option   | Meaning              | Allowed Values                | Default   |
+|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
+| name     | name of tool         | any string                    | base name |
+| menu     | show in main menu    | false / true                  | true      |
+| context  | show in context menu | "disable" / "enable" / "node" | "enable"  |
+| terminal | run in terminal      | false / true                  | false     |
+
+With the context option "node" a tool is only shown in
+the context menu, when at least one node is selected.
+
+Example of a .json file:
+
+```
+{
+    "name": "Test tool",
+    "menu": false,
+    "context": "node",
+    "terminal": true
+}
+```
